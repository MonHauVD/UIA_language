# UIA language

I has just writen it for fun :)))

U can use changeEverythingToUIA.cpp to normal cpp file and it change to UIA version.

But it now can't completely remove all characters other than uia like:
- first line " #include "uia.h" "
- number with 2 or more character
- anytext in ""
- the quote sign
